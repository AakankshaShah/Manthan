<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

### Description
We will provide an android based online testing platform which can be used to conduct tests wrapped with all necessary precautions to reduce the chances of cheating. Here the educator will can create classes and test on web portal and all the questions will be randomly distributed among the students resulting in large number of sets.

### Features
- A secure platform for online testing.
- Interactive and easy to use.
- Grades can be accessed/ changed even after the completion of test.
- Teacher can decide if a particular question is compulsary in all the tests or not.
- Application is in locked mode so no transition between other applications (as Whatsapp,call,etc.).
- A basic facility like calculator will be present in the application so to do basic math operations.
- A list of the marks will be sent to the educator just after the completion of the test.
- Use Gmail or Student mail Id's to save student marks.
- Test will be automatically submitted after the time frame.
- We'll try to block incoming calls/ messages/ screen capture and all the unnecessary activities during the test.
